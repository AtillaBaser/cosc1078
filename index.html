<h2 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"style="font-family:verdana;">My interest in IT began when I started my secondary education. I studied Informatics during my VCE studies and found<br>it to be a very intriguing subject. I felt that by studying Information Technology in<br>university, I can help build on the knowledge I gained in VCE by performing more in depth analysis<br>into the field of IT. This will then hopefully give me the knowledge I need in the future when preparing to enter the work force.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"style="font-family:verdana;">I believed that RMIT was the best institution to choose from for IT studies, as it is a university that<br>prioritises its technological studies over others. Along with its inner-city location and ease of access<br>via public transport, it turns to be the best choice for me.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ideal job</h2>
